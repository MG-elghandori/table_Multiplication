 # Description 
 I have developed a website that displays the multiplication table as part of my educational programming project. The website aims to help people learn the multiplication table in an easy and interactive way.

The website is designed with a user-friendly interface where the multiplication table is displayed in an organized and structured manner. Users can choose the number they want to multiply, and all the multiplication results for that number will be displayed in a formatted and organized way.

I used programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in developing the website. Additionally, Bootstrap was used to give it a more appealing design.

I'm proud of this project and look forward to sharing it on GitHub. If you need any assistance in downloading it or any additional information, feel free to ask any questions.
